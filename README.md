protoqueue
==========

A very simple queueing library which uses the SiteMorph/protostore backing to
support prefix matched queue events and scheduling time.

Note that this project is in the initial phases and has only had limited test.

Note that this project uses linux specific protoc commands for protobuf 
compilation. 

Note that you must have protobuf compiler installed.

See unit tests for usage.
